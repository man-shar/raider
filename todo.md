1. I think being able to summarize or give key sections from a cited source would be terribly helpful
2. e.g. sometimes they just reuse results from some other paper e.g. using rmsnorm improves xyz by abc, then I'd like to see a quick summary / visual / paragraph from the quoted original source (edited)
