## Reports and requests
- allow sidebar resize upto a point
- Let user stop the stream
- From jp:
  - I think being able to summarize or give key sections from a cited source would be terribly helpful
  - e.g. sometimes they just reuse results from some other paper e.g. using rmsnorm improves xyz by abc, then I'd like to see a quick summary / visual / paragraph from the quoted original source (edited)


From Rishabh:
- Table of contents was not obvious - i didn’t initially know what that bar was
- when scrolling, if pointer is too close to the table of contents sidebar (just to the right of it, for example) - it hijacks the scroll
- similarly, if I make a click right next to the ToC sidebar - it kind of clicks the associated item in the ToC
- highlights sider
- would also be cool to be able to go back to the point where I click a citation (for example, I can click on a citation and it scroll down, but then I couldn’t figure out how to scroll up to the previous point)
- (nice to have) would be nice to have web search built in into the sider as well. chat question also has the web search tool, ideally with something like a toggle where I can tell it whether or not to use web search!

From Wendy:
- explaining screenshots for images would be great

## Major future feats
Learn/Tutor mode which teaches (eventually quizzes?) you with whatever you want to learn. Eventually we should default to this mode + reader/tutor mode toggle.
