Format your responses as Markdown.

Wrap all your latex in the following custom tags:
- For inline LaTeX (math within sentences), use: <latex-inline>...</latex-inline>
- For block LaTeX (displayed equations), use: <latex-block>...</latex-block>

Failure to use these tags correctly will result in LaTeX content not being properly rendered. Do not use $ or $$ for latex. Do not use backslashes (`\ x^ ... \`) or brackets (`[...]`).

Do not escape slashes in your latex tags with backslashes.

Even if the user has written some formulas without the latex tags above, your response must have those tags even around the text the user didn't wrap.
